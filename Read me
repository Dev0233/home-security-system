Introduction:
Welcome to the 4-Layer Security System ReadMe! This document serves as a guide for setting up a robust security system utilizing multiple layers of authentication.
This system integrates a password, OTP (One-Time Password), RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification), and fingerprint recognition for enhanced security.
The system is built using ESP32 microcontroller, buzzer, RFID module, relay, R307 fingerprint sensor, OLED display, and a 12V BMS (Battery Management System).

Components:
ESP32 Microcontroller: The core of the system, responsible for managing all the components and executing the security protocols.
Buzzer: Used for audible feedback during authentication processes and alerting for unauthorized access attempts.
RFID Module: Utilized for RFID card-based authentication.
Relay: Controls the access to the secured area, allowing entry upon successful authentication.
R307 Fingerprint Sensor: Enables fingerprint-based authentication, adding an extra layer of security.
OLED Display: Provides visual feedback and instructions during the authentication process.
12V BMS: Powers the system and ensures stable operation.

Installation:
Hardware Setup:
Connect the components as per the schematic diagram provided with this ReadMe.
Ensure all connections are secure and there are no loose connections.

Software Installation:
Install the necessary libraries for ESP32, RFID module, OLED display, and fingerprint sensor in your Arduino IDE.
Download the code provided in the repository and upload it to your ESP32 board.
Customize the code according to your requirements, such as defining authorized users, setting up passwords, OTPs, etc.

Usage:
Power On:
Connect the 12V BMS to power on the system.
Wait for the system to initialize.

Authentication Process:
Approach the security system.
Input the password through the keypad provided in the system. This is the first layer of authentication.
Upon successful password entry, the system will prompt for an OTP.
Enter the OTP received on your registered device. This is the second layer of authentication.
If the OTP is verified(by blynk app), the system will request RFID authentication.
Present your RFID card/tag to the RFID module.This is the third layer of authentication.
Finally, place your finger on the fingerprint sensor. This is the fourth layer of authentication.
If all authentication layers pass successfully, the relay will be triggered, allowing access to the secured area.

Access Granted / Denied:
If access is granted, the buzzer will emit a confirmation sound.
If any authentication layer fails, the buzzer will emit an alert sound, and access will be denied.

OLED Display:
The OLED display will provide visual feedback during the authentication process, guiding the user through each step and displaying status messages.

Maintenance:
Regularly check the connections and components for any signs of damage or malfunction.
Update the authorized user database and security protocols as required.
Ensure the system software is up-to-date with the latest security patches and improvements.

Disclaimer:
This security system is designed to enhance security but may not be foolproof. It is recommended to use it in conjunction with other security measures.
The system owner is responsible for ensuring compliance with local regulations and laws regarding the use of security systems.

Troubleshooting:
Refer to the troubleshooting section in the provided documentation for common issues and their solutions.
